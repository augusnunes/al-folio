Hello there. I'm a Statistics and Data Science undergrad student @ ICMC/USP that love to dance, songs and to discuss about series.

I believe scientific methodology and statistical testing are essential for all kind of problems, optimization is also a smart way of solving problems and NLP for portuguese deserves more investments. 

Now, I'm currently studyng Topic models and unsupervised methods applied in portuguese texts, data streams and autoML.
